# Numerical Programming Projects

Welcome to my deep dive into **Numerical Programming**! This repository is a collection of projects where I explore numerical methods and computational mathematics using Python.

## 🔥 What’s Inside?
Each project is structured with a `src/` folder containing the main implementation, and if applicable, a `docs/` folder with well-documented explanations available in both **PDF** and **HTML** formats—whatever suits your preference! 🚀

### 📦 Tech Stack
- **Python** 🐍 – The core language for all implementations.
- **NumPy** 📊 – For efficient numerical computations.
- **Matplotlib** 📈 – To visualize results and insights.
- **OpenCV** 📷 – Used for computer vision applications, such as image processing.

## 📚 Current Projects
### 🔹 Clustering
Exploring various clustering algorithms such as:
- **K-Medoids**
- **K-Means**
- **DBSCAN**

### 🔹 Finite Differences & Floating Point Errors
- Approximating derivatives using **central, backward, and forward differences**.
- Understanding the **accuracy limitations of small floating-point values** in Python.

### 🔹 Gradient Descent Algorithms
Experimenting with different gradient descent approaches:
- **Batch Gradient Descent**
- **Momentum-based Gradient Descent**
- **Stochastic Gradient Descent**

### 🔹 Image Resizing & Interpolation
- **Upscaling & downscaling images** using interpolation techniques like:
  - Nearest-neighbor interpolation
  - Bicubic interpolation
  - Bilinear interpolation

### 🔹 Matrix & Vector Norms
- Computing various **vector and matrix norms** to analyze numerical stability and conditioning.

### 🔹 Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) Modeling
- Solving **differential equations** numerically using:
  - **Runge-Kutta (RK) methods**
  - **Newton’s method**
- Applications include **financial capital, predator-prey relationship and oscillator differential models**.
